# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a robust movie recommendation system using the classic MovieLens 1M dataset. The analysis moves beyond a single modeling technique to explore the implementation of a **Content-Based** model, a **Collaborative Filtering** model (using SVD), and the concept of a **Hybrid System**.

## The Challenge: Sparsity & The "Cold Start" Problem

A primary challenge for recommendation engines is data sparsity and the "cold start" problemâ€”how do you make good recommendations for new users or new movies with little to no historical data? This project explores how different models can address this challenge.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **MovieLens 1M Dataset**.
-   It contains 1,000,000 ratings from 6,040 users on 3,706 movies.
-   The data is spread across three files: `ratings.dat`, `movies.dat`, and `users.dat`.

## Methodology

This project implements and evaluates two primary recommendation models:

1.  **Model 1: Content-Based Filtering:**
    * This model recommends movies based on their features. It calculates the similarity between movies using their genres (processed with `TfidfVectorizer`) and finds items that are similar to a user's known preferences using cosine similarity.

2.  **Model 2: Collaborative Filtering (SVD):**
    * This model uses the **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** algorithm, a powerful matrix factorization technique, to identify latent user and item factors. It recommends movies based on the tastes of similar users.
    * The model was built and evaluated using the `surprise` library.

3.  **Hybrid System Concept:**
    * A hybrid function was developed to conceptually combine the outputs of both models, aiming to provide recommendations that are both relevant (from content) and personalized (from user taste).

## Key Findings & Evaluation

The collaborative filtering model was established as the primary benchmark and was quantitatively evaluated on its ability to create a high-quality ranked list of recommendations.

-   **Average Precision@10: 87.3%** - On average, nearly 9 out of the 10 movies recommended to a user were relevant and liked by them.
-   **Average Recall@10: 36.8%** - The model successfully identified over a third of all movies a user would have enjoyed within its top-10 list.

These strong metrics validate the effectiveness of the SVD-based collaborative filtering approach. The project also highlighted the importance of a rigorous and fair evaluation framework when considering more complex hybrid systems.

## Technologies Used

## Future Improvements

-   **Deep Learning:** Implement a more advanced model using neural networks (e.g., using Keras or PyTorch) for matrix factorization.
-   **Incorporate More Features:** Enhance the models by including user data (age, gender, occupation) or more movie metadata.
-   **Deployment:** Deploy the hybrid model as a simple interactive web application using Streamlit or Flask.
